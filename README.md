<h2>How did I get to know programming?</h2>

<p align="left">Hello, my name is Seyyed Amir Nima Ghabisi.

I am from the city of Zanjan. I was interested in electronics since I was a child. I wanted to learn and make more things. My cousin taught me about electronics and I progressed so much that I reached the programming section of Arduino boards and from there I fell in love with programming.

I started learning programming from the age of 12. I first learned C# language and despite all the difficulties I was able to become a professional in it, and with many courses that I bought from sites like Faradars, I learned more difficult things, but with a good C# language. I couldn't achieve my goals in programming, so after a lot of searching and consulting with experienced programmers, I got to know the Flutter framework. At first, I watched a few courses of it on YouTube and saw that it had a lot of what I wanted, and finally the Flutter framework. I chose and started learning this powerful and cool framework.

Besides programming, I also have other small skills such as working with Word and PowerPoint software, typing.

I am happy to help you.

You can see the certificates I have received so far in Flutter programming:
